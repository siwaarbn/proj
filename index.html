                        <h4>Red Personnality</h4>
                        <p>IN SOCIAL LIFE:Reds are strong leaders, fast paced thinkers, risk takers, purposeful, drivers, strong-willed, high energy, competitive and rational. You may recognise many of the qualities in many leaders as they take ownership, need to be fast paced in their thinking, take risks and be purposeful and confident with it. They don’t like waffle and tend to lack patience.</p>  
                        <p>IN BUSINESS:If you want to help red, in a work environment, you need to demonstrate the benefits that come with the details. It’s all well and good having a destination but cutting corners can cause problems! After they’ve successfully completed a project, focusing more on the details, have a chat with them about the benefits of doing this – using real life examples.</p>

                        <h4>Blue Personnality</h4>
                        <p>IN SOCIAL LIFE:Blues are deep thinkers, analytical in nature, very detail focused and formal in their thinking. They can come across as being aloof, but are deliberate in their approach and systematic, precise and pays attention to detail. Blues like things in their place, and are very organised with good time management skills.</p>  
                        <p>IN BUSINESS:While taking their time and being thorough is important, sometimes we’re working to tight deadlines and a fast turn around is necessary. In these instances, explain to blues the time frame and the importance of finishing a project. Be sure to offer support and explain the importance of prioritising and delegating tasks. This way they won’t feel immense pressure and worry about burnout.</p>

                        <h4>Green Personnality</h4>
                        <p>IN SOCIAL LIFE:Greens are cool, laid back, relaxed and patient. They are easy to get along with and very informal in their approach. Greens are social and focus on relationships so can come across as emotional. They are much slower paced in their thinking and are very democratic people. They’re very understanding, and agreeable.</p>  
                        <p>IN BUSINESS:Because of this laid back attitude, Greens tend not to like friction, so we would advise discussing any criticisms in private. They may need reassurance not to take the criticism personally, but rather professionally, to avoid them shutting down emotionally.</p>

                        <h4>Yellow Personnality</h4>
                        <p>IN SOCIAL LIFE:Yellows are the life and soul of the party, they are sociable, expressive, very imaginative and enthusiastic with it. Yellows are very informal, very optimistic and animated. Their Imaginations can sometimes run away with them as they are very fast paced thinkers. Yellows are very relationship focused and are visionaries with obvious high energy.</p>  
                        <p>IN BUSINESS:Because yellows are such high energy, sometimes it can be difficult to gage whether or not they’ve taken in what you’ve said. You need to strike the right balance between confirming they understand what you’ve said, and being patronising. Yellows are the type to engage in non-work related conversations.</p>
